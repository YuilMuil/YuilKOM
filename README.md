# YuilKOM
 A KOM file manager for KOMv4/v5/v6 written by YuilMuil
 
## Overview
This C++ project, authored by YuilMuil and released under the GPLv3 license, provides a robust solution for unpacking and packing Elsword's KOMv4, KOMv5, and KOMv6 file formats. It seamlessly supports Algorithm 0, Algorithm 2, and Algorithm 3 encryption/decryption algorithms.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop functionality for ease of use.
- Unpack KOMv4, KOMv5, and KOMv6 file formats.
- Pack modified files back into the supported formats.
- Encryption and decryption support for algo0, algo2, and algo3 algorithms.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/elsword-unpacker/releases) page or compile it yourself.
2. Drag and drop your KOM file onto the executable to unpack.
3. Modify the unpacked files.
4. Drag and drop the modified files or folder onto the executable to pack.

## Supported Algorithms
- Algorithm 0: Simple XOR encryption
- Algorithm 2: Custom encryption algorithm
- Algorithm 3: Advanced encryption algorithm
